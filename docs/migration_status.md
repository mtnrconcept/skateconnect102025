# Migration Status for Supabase Spot Ratings Comment Column

## Summary
- Attempted to run the requested Supabase migration to add the `comment` column to `spot_ratings`.
- The Supabase CLI is not available in the current environment, preventing execution of `supabase db push`.
- Database connection credentials/configuration are also missing, so migrations cannot be applied from this environment.
- Because the migration cannot be applied, the follow-up steps (`NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';` and re-testing the ratings endpoints) remain blocked.

## Details
1. Verified the migration file `20251020150000_add_spot_ratings_reviews.sql` exists in `supabase/migrations`.
2. Attempted to run `supabase --help` and `supabase -v` to confirm CLI availability, which resulted in `command not found`.
3. Checked for a local `psql` client to execute the `NOTIFY` statement manually; `psql` is also unavailable in this environment.
4. Without the Supabase CLI, database connection details, or a Postgres client, `supabase db push` (or equivalent commands) cannot be executed, so the schema cache refresh and endpoint retests could not be performed.

## Next Steps
- Install the Supabase CLI in the execution environment.
- Ensure the Supabase project reference, access token, and database password are configured (e.g., via `supabase/config.toml` or environment variables).
- Once connectivity is established, run the migration command, execute `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';`, and retest the PostgREST endpoints to confirm the missing-column fallback is no longer triggered.
