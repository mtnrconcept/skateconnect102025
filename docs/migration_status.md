# Migration Status for Supabase Spot Ratings Comment Column

## Summary
- Attempted to run the requested Supabase migration to add the `comment` column to `spot_ratings`.
- The Supabase CLI is not available in the current environment, preventing execution of `supabase db push`.
- Database connection credentials/configuration are also missing, so migrations cannot be applied from this environment.

## Details
1. Verified the migration file `20251020150000_add_spot_ratings_reviews.sql` exists in `supabase/migrations`.
2. Attempted to run `supabase --help` to confirm CLI availability, which resulted in `command not found`.
3. Without the Supabase CLI and project configuration, `supabase db push` (or equivalent commands) cannot be executed, and therefore the schema cache refresh (`NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';`) and endpoint retests could not be performed.

## Next Steps
- Install the Supabase CLI in the execution environment.
- Ensure the Supabase project reference, access token, and database password are configured (e.g., via `supabase/config.toml` or environment variables).
- Re-run the migration command, execute the `NOTIFY` statement, and retest the PostgREST endpoints once connectivity is established.
